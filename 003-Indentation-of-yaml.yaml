Indentation
Indentation and separation are the two main concepts when you are learning any programming language.
Indentation of YAML
YAML does not include any mandatory spaces. Further, there is no need to be consistent. The valid YAML indentation is shown below
  a:
   b:
      - c
      -  d
      - e
  f:
      "ghi"

There are two styles which we can write our YAML;

Block Styles : The block style is the YAML that you've probably seen before and 
are somewhat familiar with. It's the less compact and often indented traditional 
YAML that makes it easy for us humans to look at the file,

Less Compact
Better for Humans

-
  name: John MC
  hr:   65
  avg:  0.278
-
  name: James Oliver
  hr:   63
  avg:  0.288

Flow Styles : The flow styles are an extension of JSON that allows for YAML 
and JSON to sort of work together. It's less human-readable, but they are sometimes 
better for the computer that processing your YAML and flow styles rely on folding lines of content.

An Extension of JSON

John MC {hr: 65, avg: 0.278}
James Oliver: {
    hr: 63,
    avg: 0.288
  }

The flow content of YAML spans multiple lines. The beginning of flow 
content begins with " { " or " [ " .
The block list items include same indentation as the surrounding block level 
because `-` is considered as a part of indentation.
Example:
--- !clarusway.com/^invoice
 invoice: 20201
 date   : 2-3-2020
 bill-to: &id002
   given  : Aaron
   family : A
   address:
      lines: |
            112 darken Dr.
            Suite #012
      city    : Royal Oak
      state   : MI
      postal  : 121212
