Basics of YAML
When you are creating a file in YAML, you should remember the following basic rules

NOTE
YAML is case sensitive
The files should have .yaml(or .yml)as the extension
YAML does not allow the use of tabs while creating YAML files; spaces are allowed instead

Avoid ! :
YAML does not allow the use of tabs. Spaces are used instead of tabs because tabs are not universally supported.
The key-value is YAML's basic building block. The key is always a string. The value is a scalar so that it can be any data type.

Key: Value

Fruit: Banana
Meat: Checken
Cource: Clarusway

A list:

- 1
- false
- 'a string'

A dictionary

key1: val1
key2: val2
key3: val3

---Conventional Block Format uses hyphen+space to begin a new item in a specified list.

 # Courses
 - Aws/DevOps
 - Web Developer
 - QA Tester

Inline format is delimited with comma and space and the items are enclosed in JSON (similar to JSON).
 --- # Course List
   [Aws/DevOps,  Web Developer, QA Tester]

---Folded text converts newlines to spaces and removes the leading whitespace.
   - {name: John MC, age: 18}
   - name:James Garcia
     age:19
