YAML Basic Elements
Comments in YAML begins with the ( # ) character.
# this is single line comment.
YAML does not support multi line comments. If you want to provide comments for multiple lines, you can do so as shown below.
# this
# is a multiple
# line comment

Comments must be separated from other tokens by whitespaces.

The indentation of whitespace is used to denote structure.

Tabs are not included as indentation for YAML files.

List members are denoted by a leading hyphen ( - ).

List members are enclosed in square brackets and separated by commas.

Associative arrays are represented using a colon ( : ) in the format of key-value pairs. They are enclosed in curly braces {} .

Multiple documents with single streams are separated with 3 hyphens ( --- ).

Repeated nodes in each file are initially denoted by an ampersand ( & ) and by an asterisk ( * ) mark later.

YAML always requires colons and commas used as list separators followed by space with scalar values.

Nodes should be labeled with an exclamation mark ( ! ) or double exclamation mark ( !! ), followed by a string that can be expanded into a URI or URL.

Basics
All YAML files can optionally begin with --- and end with .... This is part of the YAML format and indicates the start and end of a document.

# A list of courses
- AWS
- DevOps
- Web Developer
...

A dictionary is represented in a simple key: value form (the colon must be followed by a space):
# Courses 
AWS:
    name: AWS Course
    job: Developer
    level: Advance

More complicated data structures are possible, such as lists of dictionaries, dictionaries whose values are lists or a mix of both:
# Employee records
-  john:
    name: John Clarusway
    job: Developer
    skills:
      - python
      - js
-  james:
    name: James Garcia
    job: Developer
    skills:
      - fortran
      - erlang
