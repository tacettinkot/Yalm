Collections and Structures
Collections
YAML includes block collections that use indentation for scope. Block sequences indicate each entry with a dash and space ( - ).

Mappings use key-value pair representation with the usage of colon and space (: ) .

Example of Sequence:
 - John
 - James
 - Aaron
 - Oliver
 - Walter 

Example of Mapping:
 hr: 160
 avg: 0.298
 rbi: 153

Example of Mapping to Sequence:
 AWS-DevOps:
 - Linux
 - AWS
 - Docker

 Developer:
 - Html
 - Css
 - js

Example of Sequence of Mappings:
 -
  name: Aaron
  age: 35
  job: Developer
 -
  name: Oliver
  age: 36
  job: Developer

Example of Sequence of Sequences:
 - [name  , age, job  ]
 - [Aaron , 35  , Developer]
 - [Oliver , 36  , Developer]

Example of Mapping of Mappings:
 Aaron: {age: 35,  job: Developer}
 Oliver: {
   age: 36,
   job: Developer
  }

Structures
YAML uses three dashes ( --- ) to separate directives from document content. 
This also serves to signal the start of a document if no directives are present. 
Three dots ( ... ) indicate the end of a document without starting a new one, 
for use in communication channels.

Repeated nodes (objects) are first identified by an anchor (marked with the 
ampersand - & ) , and are then aliased (referenced with an asterisk * ) thereafter.

person:
  name: &name "Oliver"
  occupation: 'programmer'
  age: 33

id: *name #Oliver

A question mark and space ( ? ) indicate a complex mapping key. Within a block 
collection, key: value pairs can start immediately following the dash, colon, 
or question mark.
